## 🌟 Hackathon Theme Integration

**Theme**: *"In a world made only of colors and sounds, how would emotions speak? If music could show what we think, what would your silence create? Between light and sound, could a new kind of language be born?"*

### Our Answer: **YES!**

IMPOSTER HUNT is a social deduction game (like Among Us) where traditional communication is replaced by a revolutionary system of **colors and emotional sounds**.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

### **Your Identity = Your Color**
- No names, only colors
- 🔴 Red, 🔵 Blue, 🟢 Green, 🟣 Pink, 🟡 Yellow, 🟠 Orange
- Your color is your identity in this world

### **Your Thoughts = Emotional Sounds**
Instead of text or voice chat, express yourself through 5 emotional sounds:
- 🤔 **Suspicious** - Questioning tones
- 👆 **Accusing** - Sharp, assertive sounds
- 🛡️ **Defending** - Protective, reassuring tones
- 😕 **Confused** - Dissonant, uncertain notes
- ✅ **Innocent** - Clear, harmonious sounds

### **Truth = Sound Patterns**
When multiple players express emotions about someone, the sounds layer and combine. Patterns emerge:
- Red gets 3 suspicious + 2 accusing = Probably guilty
- Blue gets 5 innocent sounds = Likely crewmate
- Green gets mixed signals = Uncertain

**This IS a new language** - one born from the synthesis of light and sound.

## 🎯 Game Objective

### **Crewmates** (Most Players)
- Complete tasks around the spaceship
- Find dead bodies and call meetings
- Use colors and sounds to identify the imposter
- Vote out the imposter to win

### **Imposters** (1-2 Players)
- Sabotage the crew
- Kill crewmates without being seen
- Blend in during meetings
- Avoid being voted out

---

## 🕹️ How to Play

### **1. Game Phase** (Silence & Mystery)
- Move with **WASD** or **Arrow Keys**
- Complete tasks at yellow stations (**Space** to use)
- Imposters can **kill** nearby players (**Q** key)
- Find bodies and **report** them (**R** key or click REPORT)
- Call **emergency meeting** from Cafeteria

### **2. Meeting Phase** (Colors & Sounds)

#### **Phase 1: Express Through Sound** 🎨
- Click on a colored player
- Choose an emotional sound
- Your emotion is recorded and played
- Others see your emotional expression

#### **Phase 2: Decode Sound Patterns** 🎵
- Click any player to hear their "emotional symphony"
- Sounds layer together (3 suspicious + 2 accusing + 1 defending)
- Visual indicators show emotion counts
- Listen for patterns that reveal truth

#### **Phase 3: Vote by Color** 🗳️
- Based on colors and sound patterns, vote who to eject
- Or skip the vote
- Player with most votes is ejected
- Game reveals if they were imposter or not

### **3. Victory Conditions**
- **Crewmates Win**: All imposters ejected OR all tasks completed
- **Imposters Win**: Equal or outnumber crewmates

## 🎨 The New Language

### Visual Vocabulary (Colors)
```
Color = Identity
Glow = Presence
Pattern = Behavior
```

### Auditory Grammar (Sounds)
```
Emotion = Word
Layer = Sentence
Pattern = Truth
```

### The Synthesis
```
WHO (Color) + WHAT (Sound) + PATTERN (Reasoning) = Communication
```

**Example**:
- "Red" (color identity)
- Got 3x "Suspicious" sounds (emotional expression)
- Pattern shows high accusation (reasoning)
- **Result**: Red is likely the imposter

## 🎯 Pro Tips

### For Crewmates:
- **Listen carefully** to sound patterns in meetings
- **Watch colors** - who was near the body?
- **Complete tasks** to win without voting
- **Use emergency meetings** wisely

### For Imposters:
- **Kill in isolated areas** (limited vision helps you)
- **Defend others** to seem innocent
- **Create confusion** with mixed emotions
- **Blend in** - don't be too quiet or too loud

### Reading the Sound Language:
- **Many suspicious sounds** = High guilt
- **All innocent sounds** = Likely safe
- **Mixed patterns** = Uncertain, need more info
- **No sounds** = Player was ignored, suspicious?

---

## 🌌 The Philosophy

### "What would your silence create?"
Between meetings, there is only silence. No chat, no voice. This silence creates:
- **Tension** - What are others thinking?
- **Mystery** - Who can you trust?
- **Anticipation** - What will the next meeting reveal?

The silence makes the sound more powerful.

### "Between light and sound, could a new kind of language be born?"
Yes. In IMPOSTER HUNT:
- **Light (Color)** defines WHO you are
- **Sound (Emotion)** expresses WHAT you think
- **Pattern (Synthesis)** reveals WHY it matters

Together, they form a complete communication system - a new language for a new world.
