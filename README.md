# 🚀 IMPOSTER HUNT

> A wordless multiplayer game where emotion replaces language.
> Players communicate only through color, light, shape, sound, and music to sense trust, suspicion, and intent.
> Inspired by Among Us, the game explores how meaning and decision-making emerge without words.
> **A new emotional language is formed between light and sound.**

**Theme**: *"In a world made only of colors and sounds, how would emotions speak?"*
